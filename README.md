# OpenVAS exporter
OpenVAS (also known as GSM) exporter for prometheus.
Supports SSH and TLS (not tested) connections. Tested with GVM Version 21.4.3, another versions not tested, so, there is no guarantee that the exporter will work.
## Usage and preparations
There is 2 variation of use exporter: compiled package with dependencies (download in releases) or pure python script from sources, but need to install dependencies.
### Dependencies
If you choose pure python script, you need to install following libs with pip:
```
pip install lxml prometheus-client python-gvm
```
### SSH connection for GVM
You need some setup on GVM Server for SSH connection, first of all install and enable ssh:
```
apt/yum install ssh
systemctl enable ssh
systemctl start ssh
```
Install socat:
``` 
apt/yum install socat
```
Create user with shell, connected to gvm unix-socket
```
echo "#! /bin/bash
socat UNIX:/var/run/gvm/gvmd.sock -
" > /home/shell.sh

chmod +x  /home/shell.sh
useradd -s /home/shell.sh user
usermod -a -G _gvm user
```
_Group can be **gvm** and another path to socket file, depends on your GVM installation_.
